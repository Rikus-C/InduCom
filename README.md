## Short Summary
InduCom is short for Industrial Communication. As the name implies, InduCom is a framework, written in C, that makes applying industrial communication protocols easy, reliable and inexpensive. It does so by giving you access to a set of tools that allow for seamless integration of all major communication systems used in industrial environments.

The framework can be used as a stand alone communication system for a project or, it can be implemented in an existing project that already has certain standards in place that can't be changed.
## Where The Idea Came From
During my 2 years of experience working as a Electronic Engineer in the mining industry, one of the major problems I faced when designing a system is choosing a communication protocol for the system, since not all devices that form part of a system supports the same communication protocols. This can lead to extra equipment having to be used to allow different devices using different protocols to communicate with one another, thus making the system more expensive and harder to understand. I then started looking into methods that can be used to allow easy integration of different communication protocols, without breaking the bank.
