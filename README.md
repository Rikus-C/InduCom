## About InduCom
InduCom is short for Industrial Communication. As the name implies, InduCom is a framework, written mostly in C, that makes applying industrial communication protocols easy, reliable and inexpensive. It does so by giving you access to a set of tools that allow for seamless integration of all major communication systems used in industrial environments.

The framework can be used as a stand alone communication system for a project or, it can be implemented in an existing project that already has certain standards in place that can't be changed.
## Short Comings
There sre however some short comings with a using something like InduCom.
### Hardware Support
Because some methods of industrial communication require spesific hardware it can make integrating cetain protocols difficult or even impossible. However, I would like to design some hardware as well that can seamlesly integrate with a computer to allow for these communication methods to be usable.
### Licensing
Not all protocols are open source, meaning they can't be recreated. Not much I can do about that.
## Use Cases
Even though till thus far I emphisized on InduCom being used for industrial systems, it can easily be used for other sectors as well for all sorts of applications. Some use cases being:
- Data logging
- Data proccessing
- Protocol conversion
- Networking
- Home automation
- IOT
