## About InduCom
InduCom is short for Industrial Communication. As the name implies, InduCom is a framework, written mostly in C, that makes applying industrial communication protocols easy, reliable and inexpensive. It does so by giving you access to a set of tools that allow for seamless integration of all major communication systems used in industrial environments.

The framework can be used as a stand alone communication system for a project or, it can be implemented in an existing project that already has certain standards in place that can't be changed.
## Where The Idea Came From
During my 2 years of experience working as a Electronic Engineer in the mining industry, one of the major problems I faced when designing a system is choosing a communication protocol for the system, since not all devices that form part of a system supports the same communication protocols. This can lead to extra equipment having to be used to allow different devices using different protocols to communicate with one another, thus making the system more expensive and harder to understand. I then started looking into methods that can be used to allow easy integration of different communication protocols, without breaking the bank. This led me to come up with InduCom.
## Short Comings
There sre however some short comings with a using something like InduCom.
### Hardware Support
Because some methods of industrial communication require spesific hardware it can make integrating cetain protocols difficult or even impossible. However, I would like to design some hardware as well that can seamlesly integrate with a computer to allow for these communication methods to be usable.
### Licensing
Not all protocols are open source, meaning they can't be recreated. Not much I can do about that.
## Use Cases
Even though till thus far I emphisized on InduCom being used for industrial systems, it can easily be used for other sectors as well for all sorts of applications. Some use cases being:
- Data logging
- Data proccessing
- Protocol conversion
- Networking
- Home automation
- IOT
